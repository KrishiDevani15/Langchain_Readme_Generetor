## üöÄ Installation Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up your environment and start using the GitHub README Generator:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repo_url>
    cd <repo_name>
    ```

2. **Set up Environment:**
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system, then install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit langchain_openai gitpython python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Configure API Keys:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your OpenAI API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'
     ```

## üéÆ Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app by running the command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. Enter the URL of the GitHub repository you wish to generate a README for and hit "Generate README".

3. If a valid URL is provided, the application will clone the repository, analyze its contents, generate a README, and present it on the interface.

4. Use the download button to save the README.md file to your local machine.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example

Imagine you want to generate a README for a repository located at `https://github.com/user/sample-repo`. Simply enter this URL into the application and click the "Generate README" button. The generator will output a detailed README.md file formatted with sections for description, features, installation, and usage instructions.
